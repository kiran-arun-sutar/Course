Kiran Sutar
Exploratory Data Analysis
The key learnings from the Exploratory data Analysis was about the univariate and bivariate variable analysis. 
Univariate analysis helps us to understand the individual columns better and making sense of how a particular attribute in the data works.
On the other hand, bivariate analysis helps us in understanding the relationships between the different attributes that make up the data.
